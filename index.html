      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
      Ipsum. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
      It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
      it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
      Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
      Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
      the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
      source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
      Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in
      45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
      during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
      sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of
      Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
      Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by
      Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by
      English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
